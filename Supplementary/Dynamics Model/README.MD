The dynamics model share notebook contains the training procedure for our dynamics model

To run the notebook yourself you will need the SPM images from both datasets:
Images from Dataset 1 can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QHwyzQ0E7kGu_7qxIg0gdog40xqZi5rA/view?usp=drive_link
Images from Dataset 2 can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X3AtDX2yUmLB3awOVEDW2AoNXpnstFln?usp=sharing

The pre-trained notebook is nearly the same, but does not contain the training loop and uses pre-trained model weights.
